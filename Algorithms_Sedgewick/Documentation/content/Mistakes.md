# Mistakes

- Forgetting argument checking.
- Sorting a copy of a container.
- Getting confused between string comparers, such as `StringComparer.Ordinal` and `StringComparer.Invariant`.
- In string algorithms, getting confused between treating chars as real chars or as integers. 
- Forgetting that when inserting a where clause between a list and a select, the indices in the select does nto 
refer to the original list.
