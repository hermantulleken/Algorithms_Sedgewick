# Algorithms API Documentation
Based on the book by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne: "Algorithms", 4th edition. This code base is mostly for 
exploration of the topic of the book. 

- @AlgorithmsSW: Detailed descriptions of all APIs, classes, methods, and more.
- @AlgorithmsSW.DataStructures: Provide default implementations of common data structures. 

## My purpose
I wanted to get experience with programming algorithms, including:

- Writing them as readable as possible. It annoys me how poorly written algorithms are (in textbooks, papers and 
Wikipedia). I think readability is important at writing correct code. 
- Developing debugging techniques.
- Getting experience with using Unit tests to ensure correctness. 
- To write documentation for the algorithms (although there is a lot lacking).
- To get experience with measuring performance and optimizing algorithms.
